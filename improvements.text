## IMPROVEMENTS
There are always chances to improve, While i was finishing it off realised that:
    It can be more modularized.
    Error and index view templates can be better
    Error Handling in a more systematic manner.
    More validations can be done like json file validation, inputs etc.
    Code can be created in a more generic way so that it should have the capability to read every attribute not 
    just two fields and MVC structure can also be followed with that.
